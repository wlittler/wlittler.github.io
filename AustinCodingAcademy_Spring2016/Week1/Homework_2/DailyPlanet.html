                        All kinds of happy little splashes. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. What the devil. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

                        We have a fantastic little sky! We don't want to set these clouds on fire. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it.

                        That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Fluff that up. Let the paint work. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind.

                        Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Here's something that's fun. Poor old tree. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

                        It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Get tough with it, get strong. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

                        A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Every time you practice, you learn more.

                        When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You can create anything that makes you happy. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world.
