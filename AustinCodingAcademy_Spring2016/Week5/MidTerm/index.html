        <p>Horizontal boosters...! Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it. Bring me the hydrospanners! I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!
            <span>But that down. Hey! That's my dinner. How you get so big, eating food of this kind? Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you just... Aww, cannot get your ship out? Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're making a mess. Hey, give me that! Mine! Or I will help you not. don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get out of this slimy mudhole. Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is. Ah, ah, ah! Oh, Artoo, let him have it. Mine! Mine! Artoo! Mine! Mine!</span></p></div>
